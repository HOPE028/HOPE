## What

Introducing HOPE, a suite of free and open-source tools designed to help students, educators, and lifelong learners improve their learning experience. Our mission is to identify common challenges faced by learners and provide practical solutions through software that is accessible and free for everyone.

Our projects are diverse, but they all share a common theme of identifying problems in the learning process and finding innovative solutions. Whether it's an app that helps you find data on any country or a tool that graphs world progress, we aim to provide practical solutions that make learning easier and more accessible for everyone.

What sets HOPE apart is our commitment to open-source software. We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to learn and grow, regardless of their financial situation. That's why we have made all our tools available for free, with the aim of creating a community of learners who can share their knowledge and experiences to help each other succeed.

_And more to come.._
